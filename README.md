# vpnHead-FE — Startup Frontend Prototype by Deividas Strole

**vpnHead-FE** is the frontend prototype for a **VPN service startup idea**, created by **Deividas Strole**. This project was designed to explore the user interface, interactions, and design flow for a secure VPN application, without being a production-ready product.

This repository represents an **early-stage startup exploration**, showcasing UI/UX concepts, component structure, and front-end logic.

## 🚀 Project Vision

The goal of **vpnHead-FE** is to:

- Demonstrate clean and modular frontend architecture  
- Prototype VPN user interface flows  
- Explore design, responsiveness, and user interaction  
- Serve as a proof-of-concept for potential full-stack implementation  

This project is **conceptual**, focusing on experimentation and design validation rather than deployment.
